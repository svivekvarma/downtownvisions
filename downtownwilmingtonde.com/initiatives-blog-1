<p>Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) are areas in which property owners agree to pay an assessment in addition to property taxes to fund privately-operated cleaning, security and marketing services. These services supplement those provided by City government. BIDs have been proven to help in reducing crime and to spark increased retail activity. Cleaner streets and sidewalks help this process.</p><p>Funding for Wilmington’s BID is provided primarily by property owners who pay an annual assessment directly to <a href="http://downtownwilmingtonde.com/mission">Downtown Visions</a>&nbsp;based on their property tax assessments.&nbsp;Other sources for the operating budget come from proceeds from our for-profit subsidiary, Clean &amp; Safe Services, Inc.</p><p>The properties with the top 10% (highest) assessed values pay approximately 80% of the overall assessments</p><h2>BID ASSESSMENT FAQS</h2><h3>How is my assessment calculated?</h3><p>Assessments are based on the following formula: Per $100 of New Castle County assessed value x .2923 = total assessment. To find out the assessed value of your property, contact the New Castle County Department of Land Use at 302-395-5400.</p><p> </p><h3>When are assessment bills mailed?</h3><p>Annual assessment bills are mailed late-June.</p><h3>When is my assessment due?</h3><p>Your bill runs from July 1 through June 30 and is due July 31.</p><h3>Where do I mail my payment?</h3><p>WDBID Management Company<br />(DBA) Downtown Visions<br />P.O. Box 71271<br />Philadelphia, PA 19176-6271</p><h3>Can I pay my bill in person?</h3><p>Yes.

<h3>Wilmington is experiencing a rebirth. With new development on the rise, opportunities for living, playing, and working are ever-increasing. Our vision of Wilmington as a premier mid-sized city in which to live, work, visit and have fun is becoming a reality. However, for this vision to be fully realized, involved parties must first work to dispel the perception that our downtown is unsafe.</h3><h2>THE HISTORY</h2><p>Downtown Visions spearheaded the formation of the Wilmington Video Safety Partnership, an ambitious, never-before tried project of providing complete coverage of Wilmington’s Business Improvement District. This was made possible with the support, both logistically and financially, of the downtown corporations, local, county and state government, local foundations, the non-profit sector and the Wilmington Police Department. By achieving an unprecedented level of cooperation between all parties involved, the goal of covering the Business Improvement District with video cameras was accomplished. In April of 2001, the Video Safety Partnership network went live.</p><h2>THE DOWNTOWN SYSTEM</h2><p>The Wilmington Video Safety Partnership was one of the first of its kind in the United States, covering an entire downtown district, while also being linked with other corporations' video systems. This network allows for the live feeding of events to law enforcement officials.</p><p>There are thirty-two cameras covering the BID which are monitored by a trained and dedicated Downtown Visions staff, seventeen hours a day, seven days a week. Overseen by retired Police Officers, the system not only allows for "live feeding" of activity to the Wilmington Police but also for monitoring calls for service received by the police at Downtown Visions headquarters. Any crime or event is then digitally recorded for future prosecutions.</p><h2>THE IMPACT</h2><p>The system has assisted the Wilmington Police and Fire departments with more than 10,000 incidents since the system went on line in April of 2001. These incidents include not only criminal acts, but also locating lost children, assisting disoriented persons, locating people in need of medical attention and discovering building fires before they were reported to the Fire Department.</p><p>For more information contact Michael Maggitti, Director of Operations, at (302) 425-5371 or mmaggitti@downtownvisions.org.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Music in the Streets</title><category>Initiatives</category><category>Resources for Businesses</category><category>Resources for Residents</category><dc:creator>Sarah Zero</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 18:02:21 +0000</pubDate><link>http://downtownwilmingtonde.com/initiatives-blog/2015/8/4/music-in-the-streets</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5515b9dfe4b0570dfe189823:55bffa25e4b0e6d1aa60cca1:55c0fe10e4b0659f4a89b04a</guid><description><![CDATA[

The result was the formation of a Main Street Steering Committee, a cooperative team of representatives from Downtown Visions, the Downtown Business Association, the City's Office of Economic Development and Wilmington City Council. After many months of meeting and planning, the Main Street Initiative here in Wilmington is in its 9th year.</p><p>Spearheaded by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a leading advocate for the historic preservation, Main Street is a proven community-driven, comprehensive methodology used to revitalize older, traditional business districts throughout the United States.

Having achieved dramatic visual improvements along Market Street through our Facade Improvement Program &amp; Security Gate Removal Project where we managed each property’s revitalization from beginning to end we have gained the respect and credibility with the property owners and businesses we are now able to engage them further.

Yet there is so much more to do. No one who visits Downtown Wilmington says it is ugly and dirty. In fact, we constantly receive praise for the dramatic improvements. Now is the time to concentrate on improving the businesses. Engage their potential customers enabling them to be aware the business exists while helping the business to improve their interior and exterior appearance, products, services and marketing. This is the only way to increase their sales and bottom line, which will in turn prompt them to hire more employees, which in turn will create jobs for the community. Most of the jobs created will be entry level which is exactly what is missing for the citizens of Wilmington. Where did you have your first job? I’ll bet it was a small business. Just imagine if each of the over 300 businesses in Downtown Wilmington hired just one person. And it doesn’t stop there…</p><p>To date all grants received for programs and projects by Main Street Wilmington have been used for capital improvements to buildings, retail recruitment and job creation. No funds have been used for administration or staffing costs.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>]]></description></item><item><title>Downtown Farmer's Market</title><category>Initiatives</category><category>Events</category><category>Resources for Residents</category><dc:creator>Sarah Zero</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 17:15:14 +0000</pubDate><link>http://downtownwilmingtonde.com/initiatives-blog/2015/8/4/farmers-market</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5515b9dfe4b0570dfe189823:55bffa25e4b0e6d1aa60cca1:55c0f2dee4b05e50da45c3f3</guid><description><![CDATA[

<p>The 2016 season of the Downtown Wilmington Farmers Market at Rodney Square will begin <strong>May 4th and operate every Wednesday, rain or shine, through October 26th from 10:00 AM. until 2:00 PM, except for June 22nd for the Jazz Fest</strong></p><p>The Downtown Wilmington Farmers market opens for business every Wednesday in beautiful Rodney Square, between 10th &amp; 11th Streets and Market &amp; King Streets. Centrally located, Rodney Square has been the center of great events such as the annual Clifford Brown Jazz Festival and First Night Wilmington and is the perfect setting for the Farmers Market. The Square comes to life each Wednesday beneath the statue of Caesar Rodney, for whom the park is named. The Farmers Market offers an array of the freshest local produce, plants, herbs and cut flowers.</p><p>The Market also offers a large assortment of beautiful handmade and other items, including arts and crafts, unique jewelry and delicious home baked goods. Stroll the Square and then relax under an umbrella at one the many café tables. Enjoy a delicious breakfast or lunch while listening to a variety of free live entertainment.</p><p>The Downtown Wilmington Farmers Market is produced by Downtown Visions, a private, non-profit company which manages Wilmington's Downtown Business Improvement District and facilitated by the City of Wilmington. We are dedicated to the goal of a more vital, vibrant downtown for all.</p><p> </p><h2>History of the Market</h2><p>The original Farmers' Market in downtown Wilmington was an eight block stretch on King Street, one of our major thoroughfares. This market consisted of local farmers selling produce and other goods from the back of their vehicles and dated back to the early 1900s. With the advent of suburbanization and the modern day supermarket, this practice virtually disappeared in Wilmington.</p><p>Trying to revitalize this disappearing but critical part of urban life, the City of Wilmington officially sanctioned a Farmers' Market about 25 years ago, relocating it to a small surface parking lot on Orange Street. Over the years the number of vendors fluctuated, but steadily declined until only two vendors remained. At this point, in 2002, Wilmington Mayor James Baker asked Downtown Visions, the management company of Wilmington's business improvement district to assume management of the Farmers' Market. At this point there were only about 9 vendors. Downtown Visions was able to recruit new farmers and other vendors but soon determined that the location lacked the critical pedestrian traffic and accessibility to support the market and to service the community at large.</p><p>Continuing to partner with the City, the Market was moved to a beautiful, but underutilized city-owned public space, Rodney Square. This square is centrally located, flanked by a myriad of downtown corporations and within easy walking distance to others as well as to Market Street, downtown's main shopping street. In addition Rodney Square is the bus transportation hub for the entire county. The move to Rodney Square made the market available not only to corporate pedestrian traffic, but also to residents who use the bus system as their primary source of transportation. Nearby downtown residents were now able to walk to and participate in the market and it transformed into a true public market where, every Wednesday, from May to October, people can find an average of forty vendors selling fresh produce, handmade crafts, baked goods, lunch foods and more. Customers can have lunch at outdoor tables, enjoy free entertainment and obtain a variety of information at the information tent.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Vendors</h2><p>For more info Contact:<br />Tucker Casey<br />Market Manager<br /><a href="http://tcasey@downtownvisions.org">tcasey@downtownvisions.org</a><br />409 N Orange St.<br />Wilmington, DE 19801<br />302-425-0196</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://downtownwilmingtonde.com/form-farmers-market-application">Vendor Application</a></p><p><strong>Farmers:</strong><br /><a href="http://www.brightspotfarms.org/">Bright Spot Farms</a><br />Locust Point Farms<br /><a href="http://www.sorbellogirls.com/">Sorbello Girls Farm Market</a><br /><br /><strong>Food Vendors:</strong><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/thebrunchboxde/">Brunch Box</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/delawareprovision">Delaware Provision Food Truck</a><br /><a href="http://www.dinosicecreamtruck.com/">Dino’s Incredible Water Ice and Ice Cream</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/Cash_flavorspot">The Flavor Spot</a><br /><a href="http://www.frenchwomenlovepasta.com/">French Women Love Pasta</a><br /><a href="http://www.horsdoeuvresbybetsy.com/">Hors d’oeuvres by Betsy </a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.idontgiveafork.com/">I Don’t Give A Fork</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/joyhotdogs">Joy Hot Dogs</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.kapowtruck.com/">KaPow Truck</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/KOI-on-the-go-136507786502207/">Koi On The Go</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.leviteawilmington.com">Levitea</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.lionheart-coffee.com">Lionheart Cafe</a><br />London Chippy Fish N Chips<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Mamas-In-The-Kitchen/180708921987409">Mamas In The Kitchen </a><br />Mama Mia<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/mojoloco302">Mojo Loco</a><br />Mrs. Bonnie's Crab Cakes<br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/mushrooms-cafe-124299054267063">Mushrooms Cafe</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/outlandishfoodtruck">Outlandish Food Truck</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/theplumpitfoodtruck">The Plum Pit</a><br />Sugar Spice &amp;

<p>Within the Wilmington Downtown Business Improvement District, a block-by-block inventory done by Downtown Visions in 2009 showed that 78% of the buildings would benefit from improved façade treatments, in order to improve their appeal and, in many cases, preserve key historic features. The external appearance of a commercial or retail building is a major factor in attracting potential customers. Statistics from the National Trust for Historic Preservation Main Street Center show that for every $1 invested in façade improvements, $18 resulted in increased Downtown business in 2012.</p><p>Since 2010, Downtown Visions’ Main Street Wilmington Program has completed forty nine (49) building projects and awarded approximately $600,000 in grants towards the restoration of buildings within Downtown Wilmington. These building projects included the removal of seventeen (17) exterior roll down security gates, twenty three (23) new business signs or awnings, new exterior lights in a dark block, the lighting of the Grand Opera House, the repainting of an entire block of buildings, and the complete restoration of twenty six (26) building facades. These improvements directly resulted in thirteen (13) new business openings as well as improve the revenues through visual appeal of twenty nine (29) existing businesses. This has inspired private owners of neglected buildings to join into the movement to revitalize downtown investing their own funds without the need for public subsidy. Both public and private investment has increased dramatically with the creation of the Downtown Development District administered through the Delaware State Housing Authority and private investment by companies like the Buccini Pollen Group.</p><p>A walk down Market Street proves that our Main Street Wilmington Program has been incredibly successful in the restoration of the once hidden and neglected historic character. The program has inspired others to become partners and new businesses to call Downtown Wilmington their home. It is our intent to continue this needed program along the 9th Street corridor and the side streets connecting with Market Street.</p><p>As a part of the Façade Improvement Program the Security Gate Removal Project is designed to not only restore the visual aspects of the buildings, but to also improve the perception of safety in the downtown. External roll down security gates have a negative psychological impact especially on visitors during the evening hours. Because current City Code does not forbid the use of these gates we have felt the need to offer 100% funding towards the removal. To reduce our costs we have managed the project internally and contracted directly with vendors. All grants awarded are for physical improvements and do not go towards soft costs. In 2012 we managed the removal of 14 external roll down security gates and facade restorations. As each of the recipients was either minority, immigrant and/or female owned, this program has led to dramatically improved communication between the small businesses and our organization with collaboration on more improvements. Each has expressed interest in doing residential on the upper floors of their properties. The ability to do multiple buildings yielded substantial savings and increased productivity.</p><p>The Main Street Wilmington program offers grants that are paid directly to the contractors doing the restoration and Downtown Visions staff oversee the entire project from beginning to end. Grants are offered on a matching basis up to $25,000 per façade or at 100% up to $15,000 when an external security gate is removed. These funds can be used for external and internal improvements when it is clear that the improvements will increase the revenue of the exiting business or enable a new business to start. It should be understood that there are no other programs in the City of Wilmington that incentivize a new business or expansion of an existing. Many of the vacant or available locations even in prominent locations do not meet current code requirements and the market lease rate is not sufficient to cover the investment needed by the property owner. This cost becomes the burden of the new business which makes the location cost prohibitive.</p><p>Even with these investments there remain significant gaps in affordable housing opportunities within Downtown Wilmington, both in physical separation between locations and in the ability for individual property owners to finance. In the 700 block of Market Street where the majority of upper floors are vacant our analysis shows twenty seven (27) new apartments could be created. Unfortunately, the cost to renovate these to meet current code requirements is estimated at $150 — $175 per square foot which makes it cost prohibitive. Currently, the only housing opportunities being created are by developers whereas the 700 block properties are minority and/or female owned.</p><p>Downtown Visions Main Street Program is currently doing a complete comprehensive inventory of every building within the Business Improvement District (BID). This analysis first will primarily focus on vacant buildings and those with vacant upper floors or underutilized. Each will be evaluated as to square footage, number and size of apartments, condos or commercial units, cost to renovate to active use and potential lease rate. Upon completion we will have the data and analysis needed in a prospectus to offer developers and property owners. It is our intent to restart the City Upstairs program which is a loan to grant program that funds the gap between cost to renovate and the revenue generated. If funds become available we will choose one to two buildings that are minority owned to renovate and create affordable housing rentals. Initial evaluation shows a $100,000 gap in cost too revenue per building. All grants are for physical improvements not architectural, engineering or professional fees.</p><p>Our nationally renowned Main Street Program is designed to help you find the right location, guide you through the process of opening your business, and even find grants and/or funding to help you get started.
